      <title>Smartest and dumbest subreddits as judged by submission title readability</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.dremio.com/blog/smartest-and-dumbest-subreddits-as-judged-by-submission-title-readibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, time to put the readability UDF from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dremio.com/blog/querying-for-reading-level-with-a-simple-udf/&#34;&gt;my last
post&lt;/a&gt; to work on some data! For today&amp;rsquo;s
analysis, I&amp;rsquo;ll once again use this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3mg812/full_reddit_submission_corpus_now_available_2006/&#34;&gt;Reddit submission
corpus&lt;/a&gt;, which
contains submission data from from the years 2006-2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions that motivate today&amp;rsquo;s analysis are simple, but fun: Which popular subreddits have the highest average
submission title reading level? Which ones have the lowest? Or, more glibly, &amp;ldquo;Which subreddits are smart, and which are
dumb?&amp;rdquo; My custom &lt;code&gt;READABILITY()&lt;/code&gt; function for Drill will help us settle this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual when performing a slightly sophisticated analysis, I first shuffle the data through some VIEWs in order to
grapple with it on my terms. In this case the prep work consisted of two VIEWs, which were constructed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE VIEW reddit_readability AS
     SELECT title, READABILITY(title) ARI, subreddit
       FROM hdfs.`/data/RS_full_corpus.json`
      WHERE over_18 = &#39;false&#39;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is in turn fed into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE VIEW reddit AS
     SELECT subreddit, COUNT(title) posts, AVG(ARI) `avg ARI`
       FROM reddit_readability
      GROUP BY subreddit;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here the query to ask for &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; subreddits (as I&amp;rsquo;ve defined them) is easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; SELECT subreddit, posts, `avg ARI` FROM reddit WHERE posts &amp;gt; 100000 ORDER BY `avg ARI` DESC LIMIT 10;
+------------------------+---------+---------------------+
|       subreddit        |  posts  |       avg ARI       |
+------------------------+---------+---------------------+
| spam                   | 287305  | 15.658034632014635  |
| longtail               | 134202  | 15.38567146310872   |
| ModerationLog          | 356311  | 12.622485326455028  |
| modlog                 | 266188  | 12.477493297559754  |
| RisingThreads          | 142485  | 11.752936255500762  |
| worldpolitics          | 163290  | 11.633828401867433  |
| WritingPrompts         | 150776  | 11.348865875111446  |
| environment            | 185858  | 11.167274719418218  |
| Random_Acts_Of_Amazon  | 184420  | 11.14375363175314   |
| conspiro               | 179705  | 10.868244970017907  |
+------------------------+---------+---------------------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results aren&amp;rsquo;t too surprising. Once the internal Reddit stuff is out of the way you&amp;rsquo;re left with some subjects
that are pretty stereotypically high-minded: global politics, literary pursuits, and environmental issues. Also
conspiracy theories, for some reason. That one&amp;rsquo;s weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright! On to the dumb stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; SELECT subreddit, posts, `avg ARI` FROM reddit WHERE posts &amp;gt; 100000 ORDER BY `avg ARI` LIMIT 10;
+-----------------------+----------+---------------------+
|       subreddit       |  posts   |       avg ARI       |

| reactiongifs          | 279156   | 4.464272224403798   |
+-----------------------+----------+---------------------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup. I can see why these subreddits are dumb. They might not be &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but they&amp;rsquo;re definitely not exactly intellectual. Instead it looks like they focus on funny stuff (jokes, Internet memes, gifs) and personal vanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to close on a more technical note that may help those of you looking to perform similar analyses: If you want
to use a Drill UDF in a cluster setting, as I did here (a six-node HDFS configuration, for those curious) be sure to
copy the relevant .jar files to the &lt;code&gt;jars/3rdparty&lt;/code&gt; directory of each machine&amp;rsquo;s Drill install. That&amp;rsquo;s all the setup required
to start using the custom functions you&amp;rsquo;ve written on big data right away!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reddit hates George Bush more than Vladimir Putin</title>
      <link>http://www.dremio.com/blog/reddit-hates-george-bush-more-than-vladimir-putin/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.dremio.com/blog/reddit-hates-george-bush-more-than-vladimir-putin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as I promised, today I&amp;rsquo;m going to show off that nifty sentiment analysis UDF for Apache Drill that I discussed in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dremio.com/blog/writing-a-custom-sql-function-for-sentiment-analysis/&#34;&gt;the last article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s data is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dremio.com/blog/old-and-busted-teasing-formerly-fashionable-websites-from-reddit-data/&#34;&gt;once
again&lt;/a&gt; provided by
this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3mg812/full_reddit_submission_corpus_now_available_2006/&#34;&gt;awesome dump of Reddit
submissions&lt;/a&gt; that
date from 2006 up through last summer. Basically I just ran the sentiment analyzer function through submission titles,
examining a selection of politicians that I thought Reddit might feel strongly about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of nitty-gritty Drill stuff, I started by first making a view for the data that includes the sentiment score as
computed by the star of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, the &lt;code&gt;SIMPLESENT()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; USE dfs.tmp;
&amp;gt; CREATE VIEW testview AS SELECT LOWER(title) title, TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(created_utc AS INT)) created, score, SIMPLESENT(title) sentiment FROM hdfs.`/data/RS_full_corpus.json`;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from there I just computed a simple average of those scores over the entire corpus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; SELECT AVG(sentiment) FROM testview WHERE title LIKE &#39;%donald trump%&#39;;
+------------------------+
|         EXPR$0         |
+------------------------+
| -0.052544239386344636  |
+------------------------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember negative scores indicate negative feelings, and likewise for positive scores. The somewhat surprising results
are compiled below in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34; src=&#34;http://www.dremio.com/img/reddit_politicians.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1&lt;/b&gt;: Sentiment analysis for various politicians based on
Reddit submission title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes, according to this sentiment analysis, Reddit definitely dislikes George Bush more than Vladimir Putin. I always
think of Reddit as overall leaning a bit left in terms of politics, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t shock me to see Barack Obama and Bernie
Sanders show up with positive values. However, it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; surprise me to see Hillary Clinton score negatively. And not
only that, she scored even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; negatively than Sarah Palin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, those of us who were frequent redditors during the 2008 election season will be far from confused by the
average sentiment score achieved by then nominal-Republican Ron Paul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit loves that guy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old and busted: Teasing formerly-fashionable websites from Reddit data</title>
      <link>http://www.dremio.com/blog/old-and-busted-tesasing-formery-fashionable-websites-from-Reddit-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.dremio.com/blog/old-and-busted-tesasing-formery-fashionable-websites-from-Reddit-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who spends even a little bit of time on the Internet knows how fickle and volatile the cultural scene is. And
there&amp;rsquo;s perhaps no greater exemplar of this volatility than Reddit. For good or bad, Reddit communities often serve as
tastemakers for the Internet at large. If your content is visible on Reddit, chances are that things are going great for
you. And if not, well, maybe not&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic for today&amp;rsquo;s post is pretty simple&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m just going to show off a cool analysis related to this
observation. The data set will be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3mg812/full_reddit_submission_corpus_now_available_2006/&#34;&gt;JSON dump of all Reddit
submissions&lt;/a&gt; from
2006 up through Summer 2015, which I&amp;rsquo;ll be analyzing for site URLs that &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be popular but have recently fallen
out of favor. The size of this dump was fairly formidable (about a quarter-terabyte uncompressed), so on the backend
this analysis was facilitated by running Drill in a cluster configuration on a Hadoop filesystem. This kept the runtime
of the somewhat sophisticated query I needed to perform down to well under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how exactly does one go about determining which Reddit submission URLs are, technically speaking, &amp;ldquo;old and busted&amp;rdquo;?
Well, I started off my analysis by constructing a view to keep track of the relevant parameters and convert them to the
correct format and units. In my case I&amp;rsquo;m interested the number of times a URL shows up in a submission, the average
posting date for each URL, and the standard deviation in submission dates (in units of days):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE VIEW reddit AS SELECT domain, COUNT(domain) counts, TO_TIMESTAMP(avg(CAST(created_utc AS FLOAT))) avg_date, STDDEV(CAST(created_utc AS FLOAT))/86400 std_dev_days
       FROM hdfs.`/data/RS_full_corpus.json`
   GROUP BY domain;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now it becomes fairly easy to construct a query on top of this view that looks for websites with old average
submission dates that also exhibit fairly strongly clustering (which I&amp;rsquo;ll define as an average submission date older
than Jan. 1, 2011 with a standard deviation in submission dates of less than 600 days). These two in combination will
define our &amp;ldquo;old and busted&amp;rdquo; criterion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The query looks like this, and returns these results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; SELECT * FROM reddit WHERE std_dev_days &amp;lt; 600 AND avg_date &amp;lt; &#39;2011-01-01 00:00:00&#39; ORDER BY counts DESC LIMIT 20;
+------------------------+---------+--------------------------+---------------------+
|         domain         | counts  |         avg_date         |    std_dev_days     |
+------------------------+---------+--------------------------+---------------------+

20 rows selected (2490.628 seconds)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this list as a starting point, I started to do a little digging (see Table 1) into why these sites are no longer
popular. What I found is that there a lot of reasons a site may end up in this ignominious category&amp;mdash;anything from
a shift in the Google search algorithm to a simple redirect to a new URL. Other explanations included acquisition, a
collapsed business model, and an outright ban of the URL from Reddit by site administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img style=&#34;max-width: 80%;&#34; src=&#34;http://www.dremio.com/img/reddit_url_table.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 1&lt;/b&gt;: A selection of formerly-fashionable websites
submitted to Reddit, and the suspected reason for their fall from grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty interesting stuff, right? I&amp;rsquo;m definitely looking forward to using Drill to hunt for even more trends in
the Reddit submission data.&lt;/p&gt;
